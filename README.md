# Classic Books and Papers
This repository contains my code and material for the playlist "Classic Books & Papers," which is available on my YouTube channel, [YUNIKARN](). Visit [Our website](https://www.yunikarn.com) for more content.

## C1: The Econometrics of Financial Markets
We explore the classic book "The Econometrics of Financial Markets" by Campbell, Lo, and MacKinlay. More than 25 years after its publication, it remains a very useful source of information. I read this book as a graduate student in Economics, and it guided me through my PhD period. In contrast to many books covering econometrics, this book is a pleasure to read. Even without a strong mathematical background, most students should be able to understand the ideas presented. Let’s have a look inside.

## C2: Event Study: Main Ideas
We introduce Event Studies, which quantify the impact of events on firms' value. We discuss estimation and event windows as well as normal returns. The latter is based on the constant-mean-return model and the market model.

## C3: Event Study: Measuring Anormal Returns
We measure abnormal returns and derive their statistical properties. This video goes deep into the theory of event studies. Enjoy more than 40 minutes of content with lots of vectors and matrices.

## C4: Mathematical Economics: A Classic Read
The Fundamental Methods of Mathematical Economics by Alpha Chiang is one of the classic books in economics – in my view. This is the third edition; the fourth edition, published in 2005 is available. But I do not think that much has changed. It is a timeless beauty. This book was my best friend during my undergraduate studies of economics at the University of Munich.

## C5: Event Study: Test Statistics
This video derives confidence intervals for cumulated abnormal returns (CARs) used in event studies. We discuss the underlying theory in detail and implement the theory using Excel.

## C6: Event Study: Excel Model
This video discusses the implementation of a constant-mean return model in Excel. We calculate confidence intervals for cumulated abnormal returns (CARs) used in event studies.

## C7: What is populism?
What is populism? In this video, we explore early literature from the 1950s. Shils (1954) attempted to define populism, which is challenging as it does not seem to have a proper ideology. The definition is crucial in measuring the degree of populism of a political movement. This matters in studies linking populism to economic and social drivers or outcomes.
